def mean(values):
    '''Return the arithmetic mean of the list of values; i.e. the 
    sum of all the values divided by the total number of values. 
    If the list contains non-numeric elements, this function throws 
    a ValueError.'''

def median(values):
    '''Return the median of the list of values. For an odd number 
    of values, if the numbers are sorted, the median occurs at the 
    center of the list. For an even number of values, the median is 
    the mean of the two middle values in the sorted list of values.'''

def mode(values):
    '''Return a list containing the mode of the list of values. The 
    mode is the most frequently occurring values in the list. For example, 
    the mode of [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1] is [0, 1].'''
